## Inline Fold - VSCode Extension
‚ö†Ô∏è NOTICE: this extension is still under development! ‚ö†Ô∏è

<br />

An extension that enables inline folding of attribute values within HTML/JSX tags. It makes your code tidy and easier to navigate.

This is especially useful when working with frameworks like Tailwind CSS which use lots of utility classes that often disfigure code visual structure. You can expand the folds by clicking on them. You can also configure the extension to target specific attributes in your markup.
